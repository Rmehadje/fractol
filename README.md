# Fractol

Fract-ol is the first graphic project developed at 42, which uses the mlx42 library to visualize complex mathematical fractals. This program specifically focuses on generating  the Julia and Mandelbrot sets, providing an interactive experience to explore these beautiful mathematical structures.

## Features
- 🌌 **Julia Set Visualization**: Generate and explore Julia sets by modifying parameters in real-time.
- 🌊 **Mandelbrot Set Visualization**: Experience the iconic Mandelbrot set and zoom into its intricate details.
- 🎨 **Interactive Controls**: Adjust parameters and colors dynamically to see how they affect the fractals.
- 🔍 **Zooming Functionality**: Zoom in on specific areas of the fractals for detailed views.
- ⌨️ **Controls Functionality**: You may control where the picture renders next using the arrow keys.

## Usage
To run the Fractol program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fractol.git
```
2. **Accessing the cloned Repository**
```
   cd fractol
```
3. **Compile and run the project**
```
  make re
  ./fractol m (for mandelbrot) or j 0.75 -0.11 (for julia, mandatory to give it two floats)
```
4. **enjoy the fractal**
  You can zoom in and move with the arrows to go to more populated areas 😄.


## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
I would like to thank 42 and the community for the help and support to give an opportunity to work on such an enjoyable project.
